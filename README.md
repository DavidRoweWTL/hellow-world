Not just another repository, but a new branch with the first!

Happy days

Git hub uses Markdown with a few Github specific addtions. [The basics are available here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) but this is a good place to [start learning how Github uses Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)

Don't forget [emoji's](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) are first class citizens in GitHub.

Have a great day @DavidRoweWTL :simple_smile:
